        <h4>Who runs Abfrage3?</h4>
        <p>Abfrage3 is a project of mine. I am Timo Denk and I decided to develop some software to make learning for tests in school easier and more efficient. The advantage of an own website (other websites with similar approaches exist) was the possibility to add every feature I or other users need or will need and of course the fun to program such a big project. Another important point are the test algorithms: They determine which word will be asked next in a test so they have a enormous impact on the total time it takes you to learn a set of words. The chance to write those algorithms exactly as I think it works best does also exist only in a self-written vocabulary trainer.</p>
        
        <h4>What about earlier versions?</h4>
        <p>Abfrage3 has a long history: The first version, "Abfrage", was written in Java and looked very awful (Screenshot 1). It was developed in October 2013. Abfrage2 was not really successful, actually it was just an attempt to create a nice <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Presentation_Foundation" target="_blank">WPF</a> layout which totally failed.</p>
        <p>In Summer 2014 the third version Abfrage3 (Screenshot 2), a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)" target="_blank">C#</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Presentation_Foundation" target="_blank">WPF application</a>, became the first version in this series of the vocabulary learning software with advanced features like uploading and sharing lists, auto translation and a lot more. It is still available on <a href="http://www.simsso.de/?type=development" target="_blank">my german website</a>. Unfortunately this version was only executable on Windows 7 and newer versions, which lead in August 2015 to the development of Abfrage3Web - the website you are currently visiting.</p>
        
        <h4>What does the name mean?</h4>
        <p>The name Abfrage3 is German and the word Abfrage [ˈapˌfʀaːɡə] means something like <i>Test</i>. For traditional reasons, the English version was also given a German name. The 3 stands for the third version (see "What about earlier versions?" above).</p>
        
        <h4>What's the ambition?</h4>
        <p>The big idea of Abfrage3Web was to create a fully functional vocabulary trainer which is fun to use. An important specification was the possibility to comfortably share word lists with other users. </p>
